Times of Fortune

Times of Fortune is an early-stage game project inspired by the idea of beautiful times — not in the sense of luxury or wealth, but in the sense of possibility, growth, and creation.

The title reflects a belief that we live in an era full of potential. These are times in which individuals can build, shape, and redefine their own paths. It also carries a subtle note of nostalgia — a quiet awareness that one day, the present moment itself will be remembered as a formative and meaningful chapter.

At this stage, the game does not yet have a fixed genre, mechanics, or defined structure. It exists as a conceptual foundation — an open space for experimentation and discovery. The direction may evolve, shift, or transform entirely as development continues.

This repository represents the origin point: the first version, the initial spark.

Times of Fortune is less about what the game currently is, and more about what it might become.
